.SH NAME
guacenc \- Guacamole video encoder
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B guacenc
[\fB-s\fR \fIWIDTH\fRx\fIHEIGHT\fR]
[\fB-r\fR \fIBITRATE\fR]
[\fIFILE\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B guacenc
is a video encoder which accepts Guacamole protocol dumps, such as those saved
when screen recording is enabled on a Guacamole connection, writing standard
video files as output.
.B guacenc
is essentially an implementation of a Guacamole client which accepts
its input from files instead of a network connection, and renders directly to
video instead of to the user's screen.
.P
Each \fIFILE\fR specified will be encoded as a raw MPEG-4 video stream to a new
file named \fIFILE\fR.m4v, encoded according to the other options specified. By
default, the output video will be \fI640\fRx\fI480\fR pixels, and will be saved
with a bitrate of \fI2000000\fR bits per second (2 Mbps). These defaults can be
overridden with the \fB-s\fR and \fB-r\fR options respectively.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-s\fR \fIWIDTH\fRx\fIHEIGHT\fR
Changes the resolution of the video that
.B guacenc
renders. By default, this will be \fI640\fRx\fI480\fR.
.TP
\fB-r\fR \fIBITRATE\fR
Changes the bitrate that
.B guacenc
will use for the saved video. This is specified in bits per second. By default,
this will be \fI2000000\fR (2 Mbps). Higher values will result in larger but
higher-quality video files. Lower values will result in smaller but
lower-quality video files.
